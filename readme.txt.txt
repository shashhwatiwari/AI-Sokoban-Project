the solver is main.py

to pick the level to be solved, choose on line 38.
to change the factor of inadmissibility, choose on line 210.
to make the search greedy-best, replace .score with .heur on line 226.
to increase the depth limit, choose on line 249.
to visualize found solutions, use pathviewer.py in folder sim.

included are fairly optimal solutions to the later 6 levels, which
you can watch played out in the visualizer.
